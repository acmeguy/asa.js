# Activitystream Analytics browser script

This is the javascript our clients can use on their web sites to allow for easy collecting of customer behaviour.

To build the bundle run 

```
$ gulp pack
```

For development mode run

```
$ sudo gulp serve
```

Sudo is necessary since the webserver delivering the script is running on both port 80 and 443 which require high privilege
